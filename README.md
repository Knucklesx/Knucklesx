### Hey, you all ðŸ‘‹
--------------------------------------

I'm <strong>Gustavo Facchinetti</strong>, I'm a former attorney, who decided, during the pandemic, to stop practicing law and start to study to become a software developer.
Since then, I became a tryber student and start the computer sciente college. 

I believe the Trybe's course will teach the basics of front and back-end, and will help me to create some links with others professional. In addtion, the college will provide knowledge in some others languages, and give a better bases to a more further understand of software development.
