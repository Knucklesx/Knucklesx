### Hey, you all ðŸ‘‹
--------------------------------------

I'm <strong>Gustavo Facchinetti</strong>, I'm a former lawyer who always loved to code. In 2021, during the pandemic, I decided stop practicing law and start to study markdown and programer languages.
Since then, I became a tryber student and start the computer sciente college.
